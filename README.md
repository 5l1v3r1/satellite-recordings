Sample WAV recordings of Amateur Satellites

This is a collection of WAV recordings for different Amateur Satellites. The recordings are useful to test decoders.

The files in this collection are WAV files at 48kHz mono. They are supposed to be short (to save space) but
contain one or a few packets which can be correctly decoded.
